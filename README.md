I started learning Python today (6/10/2023) using Jupyter, and so far it's my favorite language, I'm using a series I found on youtube by [Alex The Analyst](https://youtu.be/WUeBzT43JyY). My favorite thing so far about tech, versus other sectors I have more experience in, is the open-source free-knowledge culture. 

It's been a wild year so far, and I'm stoked to continue learning 🎉
